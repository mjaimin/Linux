The difference between pipe and FIFO is 
-> pipe don't exists as files on the filesystem so no process can open() it.
-> pipe uses the internal data structure for this (It already reserved few space for creating pipe) But FIFO is physically present in directory.
-> pipe can be accessed to the related process only(parent -child process) But fifo is accessed to unrelated process too.
-> pipe is transient in nature it exists till the process is running but FIFO exists until u deleted it from file system.
